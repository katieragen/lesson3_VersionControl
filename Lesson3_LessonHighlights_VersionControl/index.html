            </h2>
            <p class="lead">The “git init” command is used to initialize, or create, a new empty local repository. To utilize the benefits of a version control system, this is what you start with in your terminal. You can then use the metadata to link to a remote repository. Creating this type of directory comes subdirectories for objects and template files. One of these subdirectories is “head” which is the top of the master branch. You are not required to “git init” a repository before you start a new project, you may create one at any time while working with your files and even create one from an existing directory of files.</p>

        <!-- Second Featurette -->

            <img class="featurette-image img-circle img-responsive pull-left" src="http://www.clker.com/cliparts/f/e/5/e/11954452971071026229jean_victor_balin_add.svg.med.png">

                <span class="text-muted">ADD</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">The “git add” command brings a file that you are working on into the "cache" or staging area. This is done in preparation for commitment into your local repository. There are three main git stages that files can reside in: committed, modified, and staged. While in the staging area, the command "git status" can be used to view all of the new or recently modified files that are waiting to be committed. The command “git add” can be performed multiple times before a commit, and only adds file content from each time the command is run. If you need to make more changes in your next commit, you must run “git add” again to add new content to the staging area index.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">COMMIT</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">The "git commit" command brings files from your "cache" staging area into your local repository. This is done in preparation for a push into your remote repository. The command "git log" can be used to display the entire commit history. A message (-m) is recommended and typically added to each commit, specifying what changes were made. Content can be committed in several different ways. Committed snapshots can be thought of as “safe” versions of your project that you do not have to worry about accidentally losing or changing. This command is essentially the middle man between “git add” and “git push".</p>

       <!-- Fourth Featurette -->
        <div class="featurette" id="topic4">

                <span class="text-muted">PUSH</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">The “git push” command is used to transfer commits from your local repository into your remote repository. This command is an essential part of version control systems and working in teams. Once you have pushed your committed files to your remote repository, others can access them and are able to work on them. They can simple “clone” your repository and get exactly what you have been working on using your local machine, along with all of your repository history specifying each commit that had been made. They are then able to “merge” from this clone if they wish. The command “git push” can be thought of as the final step when you are done working on your files.</p>

        <div class="featurette" id="topic5">

        <h2 class="featurette-heading">Highlight #5
                <span class="text-muted">PULL</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">The “git pull” command is used to fetch from and integrate with another repository or local branch. Integration of repositories works by first replaying the changes from the -remote- master branch since the time that is had diverted from the –local- master branch. This command is great for giving access to your files to others. Specific options are available when pulling files or when others pull your files. If some time has passed since the last time you pushed your changes to the remote repository and others have since pulled your changes, made their own commits, and re-pushed them, then you can check to see what changes were made by using the command “git pull origin master” to compare them.</p>
